# Manual Attendance - Teacher Only Access

## Changes Made

### 🎯 **Access Control**
- **Teacher Only**: Manual attendance is now restricted to teachers only
- **Admin/Principal Redirect**: Admins and principals are automatically redirected to `/attendance/history` (full attendance management)
- **Other Users Redirect**: Students and other roles are redirected to `/attendance` (regular view)

### 👨‍🏫 **Teacher-Specific Features**
- **Student-Only Selection**: Teachers can only select from active students (role filtering)
- **Appropriate Labels**: All UI text updated to reflect student focus
- **Streamlined Interface**: Designed specifically for classroom attendance scenarios

### 🔄 **Redirect Logic**
```javascript
// Admins/Principals → Full Attendance Management
if (user && isAdminOrPrincipal) {
  navigate('/attendance/history');
}
// Students/Others → Regular Attendance View  
else if (user && !canRecordAttendance) {
  navigate('/attendance');
}
```

### 🎨 **UI Updates**
- **Header**: "Teacher Portal - Record attendance manually for students"
- **User Selection**: "Select Student" instead of "Select User"
- **Placeholder**: "Search students by name, email, or RFID tag..."
- **Error Messages**: "Please select a student"
- **Recent Records**: "Recent Student Entries" with "Last 5 student records"
- **Table Header**: "Student" column instead of "User"

### 📊 **Access Messages**
- **Teachers**: Full access to manual attendance entry
- **Admins/Principals**: "Teacher Access Only" message with link to attendance management
- **Others**: Access denied with link back to regular attendance

## Benefits for Teachers

### ✅ **Classroom-Focused**
- Only see students in dropdown (no clutter from staff/admin accounts)
- Clear, teacher-appropriate interface
- Quick student search and selection

### ✅ **Simplified Workflow**
1. Search/select student
2. Set date (defaults to today)
3. Choose status (present/absent/late/excused)
4. Submit attendance

### ✅ **Recent Activity**
- View recent student attendance entries
- Track attendance recording history
- Quick feedback on submissions

## Role-Based Access Summary

| Role | Manual Attendance Access | Redirect Destination |
|------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Teacher** | ✅ Full Access | N/A |
| **Admin** | ❌ Redirected | `/attendance/history` |
| **Principal** | ❌ Redirected | `/attendance/history` |
| **Student** | ❌ Redirected | `/attendance` |

## Technical Implementation

### User Filtering
```javascript
// Only show students for teachers
const filteredUsers = activeUsers.filter(userItem => userItem.role === 'student');
```

### Access Control
```javascript
const canRecordAttendance = user?.role === 'teacher';
const isAdminOrPrincipal = user?.role === 'admin' || user?.role === 'principal';
```

This ensures that manual attendance entry is specifically designed for teachers' classroom needs while appropriately directing other user types to their relevant interfaces! 🎓
