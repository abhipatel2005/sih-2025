# School-Based Data Filtering Implementation

## Problem Description
Teachers were able to see students and attendance data from all schools, not just their own school. This was a security and privacy issue as teachers should only have access to data from their assigned school.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `/users/students` Endpoint** 
**File**: `backend/routes/userRoutes.js`

**Before**: Fetched ALL students from database
```javascript
.eq('role', 'student'); // Only get students
```

**After**: Filters students by teacher's school
```javascript
// Get the current user's school_id
const { data: currentUser, error: userError } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('school_id')
  .eq('id', currentUserId)
  .single();

// Only from teacher's school
.eq('school_id', currentUser.school_id);
```

### 2. **Updated Manual Attendance Entry**
**File**: `backend/routes/attendanceRoutes.js` - `/attendance/manual` endpoint

**Added**: School verification for manual attendance
```javascript
// Verify the student belongs to the same school as the teacher
if (userData.school_id !== currentUser.school_id) {
  return res.status(403).json({ 
    error: 'You can only manage attendance for students in your school' 
  });
}
```

### 3. **Updated Attendance List Endpoint**
**File**: `backend/routes/attendanceRoutes.js` - `/attendance/` endpoint

**Added**: Automatic school filtering for teachers/principals
```javascript
// For teachers and principals, automatically filter by their school
let filterSchoolId = schoolId;
if (req.user.role === 'teacher' || req.user.role === 'principal') {
  const { data: currentUser } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('school_id')
    .eq('id', req.user.id)
    .single();
  
  filterSchoolId = currentUser.school_id;
}
```

### 4. **Updated Attendance Statistics Endpoint**
**File**: `backend/routes/attendanceRoutes.js` - `/attendance/stats` endpoint

**Added**: School filtering for statistics calculations
- Teachers and principals only see stats for their school
- Admins can see all schools (unchanged behavior)

### 5. **Updated Attendance History Endpoint**
**File**: `backend/routes/attendanceRoutes.js` - `/attendance/history` endpoint

**Improved**: Enhanced school filtering logic
```javascript
// Filter by school if needed (for teachers/principals)
if (filterSchoolId) {
  filteredAttendance = attendanceRecords.filter(record => 
    record.users && record.users.school_id === filterSchoolId
  );
}
```

### 6. **Updated Individual User Attendance Endpoint**
**File**: `backend/routes/attendanceRoutes.js` - `/attendance/user/:userId` endpoint

**Enhanced**: School permission verification
```javascript
// For teachers and principals, verify school access permissions
if (req.user.role === 'teacher' || req.user.role === 'principal') {
  if (currentUser.school_id !== userData.school_id) {
    return res.status(403).json({ 
      error: 'Access denied: You can only view attendance for users in your school' 
    });
  }
}
```

## Security Benefits

### ✅ **Data Isolation by School**
- Teachers can only see students from their school
- Attendance records are filtered by school
- Manual attendance entry restricted to same school

### ✅ **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Admins**: Can see all schools (unchanged)
- **Teachers/Principals**: Restricted to their school only
- **Students**: Can only see their own data

### ✅ **API Security**
- All endpoints verify school relationships
- Prevents unauthorized cross-school data access
- Maintains proper data boundaries

## Database Schema Used
```sql
-- Users table already has school_id foreign key
users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  school_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES schools(school_id),
  -- other fields...
);
```

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. **Teacher Login Test**
- Login as a teacher from School A
- Verify only students from School A appear in student list
- Confirm attendance records only show School A data

### 2. **Manual Attendance Test**
- Teacher tries to create attendance for student from different school
- Should receive 403 Forbidden error
- Should only succeed for same-school students

### 3. **Cross-School Access Test**
- Attempt to access attendance data using student IDs from different schools
- Should be blocked with proper error messages

### 4. **Admin Access Test**
- Admin should still see all schools (unchanged behavior)
- Verify admin can access cross-school data as before

## API Response Changes

### Student List Response Now Includes:
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Student Name", 
      "email": "student@school.edu",
      "school_id": "school-uuid",
      // ... other fields
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Responses Added:
```json
{
  "error": "You can only manage attendance for students in your school"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "Access denied: You can only view attendance for users in your school"
}
```

## Impact
- **Teachers**: Now see only relevant school data
- **Students**: Better privacy protection  
- **System**: Improved data security and compliance
- **Performance**: More efficient queries (smaller result sets)

All endpoints now properly respect school boundaries while maintaining full functionality for authorized users.
